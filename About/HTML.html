        The <strong>Hypertext Markup Language</strong>, or <strong>HTML</strong> is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser . HTML was first created by <strong>Tim Berners-Lee</strong>, <strong>Robert Cailliau</strong>, and others starting in 1989 . Hypertext means that the document contains links that allow the reader to jump to other places in the document or to another document altogether . The latest version is known as HTML5 .
        A Markup Language is a way that computers speak to each other to control how text is processed and presented .
