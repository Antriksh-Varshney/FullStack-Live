        <strong>JavaScript</strong>, often abbreviated as <strong>JS</strong>, is a programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification. <strong>JavaScript</strong> is high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. Alongside <strong>HTML</strong> and <strong>CSS</strong>, <strong>JavaScript</strong> is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web. Over 97% of websites use it client-side for web page behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries. All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on the user's device.
